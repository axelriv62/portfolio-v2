## Presentation
This project is a redesign of my portfolio, this time built with Next.js, TypeScript, React, and Tailwind.

It aims to show my skills, projects, and professional experiences in order to find an internship for my third year of a Computer Science Bachelor's degree.

More personally, this project allows me to discover Next.js, React, and Tailwind.

## Improvement Ideas

This project is constantly evolving, here are some improvement ideas I want to implement:

- Improve the design with animations, transitions, and attractive graphical elements.
- Improve the responsiveness to optimize accessibility for all screen sizes.
- Provide an English translation.
- Develop a 404 page.
